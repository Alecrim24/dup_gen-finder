# Create a reference database
#makeblastdb -in Ath.pep -dbtype prot -title Ath -parse_seqids -out Ath
# Align protein query sequences against the reference database

  ###### follow these steps 
makeblastdb -in H.m_proteome-DupGeneFinder.fasta -dbtype prot -title Hm -parse_seqids -out Hm

blastp -query H.m_proteome-DupGeneFinder.fasta -db Hm -evalue 1e-10 -max_target_seqs 5 -outfmt 6 -out Hm.blast

blastp -query M.b_proteome-DupGeneFinder.fasta -db Hm -evalue 1e-10 -max_target_seqs 5 -outfmt 6 -out Hm_Mb.blast

##### then run the software

  #move everything into a new directory called Dup
#in there you need Hm.blast Hm_Mb.blast Hm.gff Hm_Mb.gff

DupGen_finder.pl -i /nobackup/qkdf72/helixer/Annotation/fasta_proteome_files/dup/Mb_dup -t Mb -c hm -o results

## -t is the target and -c is the outgroup ###### this ultimately compares against itself and uses the outgroup 
#An outgroup helps us figure out different kinds of gene copies. It tells us which gene copies are unique to one group and which ones are shared by many groups. 
#By comparing the target genes with those in the outgroup, the software can more accurately sort these gene copies into types like whole-genome duplications (WGDs), 
#tandem duplications (TDs), proximal duplications (PDs), transposed duplications (TRDs), and dispersed duplications (DSDs).
